This project demonstrates the basic functionality of servlets in Java, focusing on two main operations: registration and data retrieval from a database.

Registration Functionality:
The project includes a simple registration form where users can input their information such as name, roll number, and marks. Upon submitting the form, the data is processed by a servlet and inserted into a database table. This functionality showcases how servlets can handle form submissions and interact with databases to persist user data.

Data Retrieval Functionality:
Another key feature of this project is the ability to fetch data from the database based on a specified roll number. Users can input a roll number, and the servlet retrieves the corresponding data from the database. The retrieved data is then displayed in a dynamic table generated by the servlet, demonstrating how servlets can dynamically generate HTML content to present fetched data to users.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on example of servlet development and database interaction using Java. By exploring the registration and data retrieval functionalities, developers can gain insights into building web applications with servlets and managing data persistence.
